# GeoIP
Powershell Script to update Maxmind GeoFiles. Trimmed for usage of the CSV files as they aren't updateable with Maxminds updater. It will only download if there is a newer file available.  
But it can be used for the mmmdb files too. Just adapt the Perma URLs. But extraction will have to be adopted as those are tar.gz and need an additional step to exctract. (i do use the maxmind updater for the normal mmdb files)
